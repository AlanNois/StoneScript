StoneScript
===========

My StoneScript code used in the **amazing** ASCII-art game [Stone Story
RPG](https://store.steampowered.com/app/603390/Stone_Story_RPG/)
to automate it.

What is this?
----------------------------------------

The game Stone Story RPG allows you to write a script to automate the player's
behaviour in the levels, so you don't have to keep looking and change weapons
at the proper times. It's great to let the game loops the levels and farm
automatically.

If you are confused by this and wonder where the script could be used, beat
the boss Nagaraja first. Once you do, you'll get the Mind stone, which can
be used to write the script (or to paste an existing one into it).



Usage
----------------------------------------

1. Create a shortcut in the game's Stonescript directory (\*) which points
   to the directory where these scripts are and name it `my`. Basically the
   Stonescript directory should have a link/shortcut to the directory of this
   project, where this Readme and the `mindstone.txt` files are.
   
   (\*):
   
   - On Windows: `%AppData%\LocalLow\Martian Rex, Inc_\Stone Story\<Steam ID>\Stonescript`
   
1. Copy-paste the content of the
  [mindstone.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheMatjaz/StoneScript/master/mindstone.txt)
  file into the in-game Mindstone UI.

In case you want to do any modifications, the documentation for the
scripting language _StoneScript_ is available on the [game
website](http://stonestoryrpg.com/stonescript/manual.html)

You are free to use the script as you wish as long as you include my name,
as indicated in the license, if you publish it anywhere else, modified or not.
