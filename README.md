StoneScript
===========

My StoneScripts used in the ASCII-art game Stone Story RPG to automate it.

The documentation for the scripting language is available on the [game
website](http://stonestoryrpg.com/stonescript/help.txt)

You are free to use the scripts as you wish as long as you include my name,
as indicated in the license.
